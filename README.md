## The Story (Why This Exists)

Picture this: It's 2 AM. Your Azure certification exam is in three days. You've got a course open on Microsoft Learn—let's say AI-102, because who doesn't love a good AI challenge at ungodly hours?

You start Module 1. Good. Clear. Then Module 2. Okay, getting longer. Then you realize something horrifying:

**This course has 12 modules.**

**Each module has 5-8 units.**

**Each unit is a separate page.**

Click. Read. Click. Read. Click. Read. Your browser now has 47 tabs open, your progress bar looks like a game of Snake, and you've lost track of where you were three times already. Did you finish Unit 3.4 or was that 4.3? Who knows? Not you.

And don't even get me started on trying to find that one specific paragraph you read yesterday. Was it in the Computer Vision module? Or was it NLP? *Where did it go?!*

The Microsoft Learn portal is great for bite-sized learning—if you're learning one bite at a time over a month. But when you need to actually *study*, to *review*, to have everything in one place you can search through? It's a maze designed by someone who really loves clicking buttons.

So I built this. Because:
- I was tired of playing "Find the Back Button"
- My browser shouldn't need therapy after a study session
- Ctrl+F is a basic human right when you're cramming for an exam
- Sometimes you just want a PDF you can read on a plane, offline, without 47 round-trips to the server

**This tool takes all those scattered micro-units and stitches them into beautiful, searchable, offline-friendly HTML and PDF files.** One file per module. All the content. Zero clicking.

You're welcome. Now go pass that exam.

## How It Works

1. **Catalog Fetching**: The script fetches course data from the Microsoft Learn Catalog API
2. **Learning Path Discovery**: Extracts all learning paths associated with the course
3. **Module Processing**: For each learning path, discovers all modules
4. **Unit Extraction**: Fetches all unit links within each module
5. **HTML Generation**: Combines all units into a single, styled HTML file per module
6. **PDF Conversion**: Uses Playwright to convert HTML files to PDF format

## Architecture

The project uses an object-oriented design with clear separation of concerns:

| Class | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| `HttpClient` | HTTP requests with consistent configuration |
| `CatalogService` | Interacts with Microsoft Learn Catalog API |
| `ContentService` | Fetches and processes web page content |
| `HtmlGenerator` | Generates combined HTML documents |
| `PdfGenerator` | Converts HTML to PDF using Playwright |
| `CourseProcessor` | Orchestrates the entire extraction workflow |

## Configuration

Default constants can be modified in `main.py`:

```python
DEFAULT_COURSE_URL = "https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/ai-102t00"
CATALOG_API_URL = "https://learn.microsoft.com/api/catalog/"
OUTPUT_BASE_DIR = "output"
```
